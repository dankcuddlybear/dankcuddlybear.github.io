				Vapour OS is a fast, easy to use and free operating system built from Arch Linux. Vapour OS is pre-configured and optimised for a complete desktop experience out of the box, and can be installed on a wide range of computers and devices, old and new. Ideal for your desktop, laptop, tablet, your home theatre or gaming PC, or home server.

			<h1 align="center">Abundant free software</h1>
			<p>
				You'll find everything you need in the official Arch Linux software repositories, as well as user-uploaded software on the Arch User Repository (AUR)<sup style="color:grey;">1</sup>. Many of your favourite programs are available on Linux and even if they aren't, you'll find a alternative that's just as good, if not better. Best of all, everything is absolutely FREE! The default app store is Octopi (pictured), which makes installing and upgrading software a breeze.

				Windows gets more and more bloated every release, with constantly changing hardware requirements. Every PC will eventually stop supporting the latest version of Windows and become stuck on an unsupported and outdated version. Vapour OS supports all x86_64 PCs, with support for ARM coming soon. Your PC, whether it's an old Core 2 Duo Dell from 2007 or a powerful gaming rig built with the latest and priciest parts, will always be fast, responsive and up-to-date. So don't throw away that old computer - breathe new life into it with Vapour OS!

			<h1 align="center">For gamers</h1>
			<p>
				Thanks to Wine, a Microsoft Windows compatibility layer, you can run Windows software and games on Vapour OS<sup style="color:grey;">2</sup>. Pictured is Rocket League running on Wine. Valve's Steam store (installed seperately) provides easy access to millions of PC games. There are also many free games, ports and emulators in the Arch Linux software repositories.

			<h3 style="color:red;" align=center>Vapour OS is still in beta. Everything is tested and working, but there may still be bugs.</h3>
			<p>
				Vapour OS comes in two editions: a middleweight edition based on the KDE Plasma desktop, and a lightweight edition for older devices based on the XFCE desktop. The KDE Plasma version is recommended for most users as it has the most features and more frequent updates. You can always switch from one desktop environment to another without reinstalling Vapour OS.
			</p>
			<img src="img/screenshot/plasma.jpg" width=25% alt="KDE Plasma desktop" align="left" style="padding-right: 2em;" padding-bottom: 2em;">
			<h2>Vapour OS KDE</h2>
			<p>
				KDE Plasma is a beatiful, advanced desktop environment with a familiar feel. It runs well on most PCs made after 2005 and doesn't consume too much resources given it's extensive functionality. KDE Plasma is well optimised for touchscreen devices.
				<br>This edition of Vapour OS features a customised KDE Plasma desktop session, with pretty colours, wallpapers and icons. Vapour OS KDE is the most maintained version of Vapour OS, with the most features and updates.

			<img src="img/clear.png" width=100% height=1px>
			<h1 align="center">Vapour OS Live installer ISO image features
			<p>
				The Vapour OS Live installer ISO image boots into either the KDE Plasma or XFCE desktop environment, depending on which one you downloaded. From there, you can try Vapour OS before installing, without making any changes to your computer or files. There are some useful programs included, listed below:
				<ul>
					<li>Firefox: A fast, private web browser. Comes with Ublock Origin (an ad blocker), Decentraleyes (a tracker blocker) and Dark Reader (makes web pages use dark theme when enabled in system settings)</li>
					<li>OnlyOffice: A Microsoft Office compatible suite of word-processing, presentation and spreadsheet programs</li>
					<li>VLC media player: A music/video player compatible with many different file formats</li>
					<li>Wine and other libraries for gaming</li>
					<li>Gparted: A graphical program to edit partitions on disk</li>
					<li>testdisk/photorec: A command-line program to recover deleted data from disk</li>
				</ul>

			<p style="color:grey;font-size:0.75em;">
				1. AUR software is built from source automatically with the PKGbuild system. AUR PKGbuilds are not guaranteed to be working, up-to-date or secure. Installing AUR software may make your system unstable. Install AUR software at your own risk. Some AUR packages are included in the CachyOS/Chaotic-AUR repositories - these are perfectly safe.
				<br>2. Compatibility is not guaranteed. Some games may have glitches or may refuse to work altogether due to anti-cheat/anti-piracy protection or using ancient code. Look for games that are "Steam Deck verified" on the Steam store.
				<br>3. All code for Vapour OS is open source, but Vapour OS still includes closed-source components (Nvidia drivers for example).
