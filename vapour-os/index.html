				Vapour OS is a fast, easy to use and free operating system built from Arch Linux.

Ideal for your desktop, laptop, tablet, your home theatre or gaming PC, or home server.

			<h1 align="center">Abundant free software</h1>
			<p>
				You'll find everything you need in the official Arch Linux software repositories, as well as user-uploaded software on the Arch User Repository (AUR). Many of your favourite programs are available on Linux and even if they aren't, you'll find a alternative that's just as good, if not better. Best of all, everything is absolutely FREE! The default app store is Octopi (pictured), which makes installing and upgrading software a breeze.

				Windows gets more and more bloated every release, with constantly changing hardware requirements. Every PC will eventually stop supporting the latest version of Windows and become stuck on an unsupported and outdated version. Vapour OS supports all x86_64 PCs, with support for x86 and ARM coming soon. Your PC, whether it's an old Core 2 Duo Dell from 2007 or a powerful gaming rig built with the latest parts, will always be fast, responsive and up-to-date. So don't throw away that old computer - breathe new life into it with Vapour OS!

			<h1 align="center">For gamers</h1>
			<p>
				Thanks to Wine, a Microsoft Windows compatibility layer, you can run Windows software and games on Vapour OS. Pictured is the Windows version of Deltarune running on Wine. Valve's Steam store (installed seperately) provides easy access to millions of PC games. There are also many free games, ports and emulators in the Arch Linux software repositories.

				Vapour OS comes in two editions: a middleweight edition based on the KDE Plasma desktop, and a lightweight edition for older devices based on the XFCE desktop. The KDE Plasma version is recommended for most users as it has the most features and more frequent updates. You can always switch from one edition to another without reinstalling.
