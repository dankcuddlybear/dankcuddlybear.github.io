		<a class="section" id="about"><h2>Oh hi there</h2></a>
		<p>I'm a year 1 Games Development student at the University of Westminster in London, England. I love video games a lot, so I decided
		to take a Game Development university course so I can learn how to make them and eventually make a career out of it. That's my dream,
		to make great games and to entertain masses of players - old and young, casual and hardcore.</p>
		<p>I was first bitten by the programming bug back in secondary school. I learned how to make games in <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/about">
		Scratch</a>, a program for creating simple 2D games by dragging and dropping code blocks. It's basically like building a game out of Legos.
		Scratch made creating games easy and fun. I think I've made at least 50 games in Scratch. Unfortunately they're long gone, but the games I'm most
		proud of include: A drawing program, a haunted house adventure game, a pseudo-3D racing game and a full port of
		<a href="https://www.halfbrick.com/games/jetpack-joyride"><i>Jetpack Joyride</i></a>. Even though it's not a proper programming language, it
		inspired to move on to more complex programming languages such as Python and C++.</p>
		<p>Aside from games development, I generally rather enthusiastic about computers and technology. Since the age of 12 I have been collecting,
		building and tinkering with computers. When people throw their old electronics away I would always find a use for them. I would fix, upgrade and
		sometimes sell or give them away to whoever needed them more. I'd make regular trips to the recycling centre and take home electronics that were
		usually either working perfectly or easily fixable. It's a shame how wasteful people are! I've fixed, upgraded and modified devices for my friends
		and family, saving them money, confusion and hassle.</p>
